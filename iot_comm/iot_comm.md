## Over the past few months, I'm privileged to be working with a talented and dedicated team, together we've built a cloud-based device and technologies that is revolutionizing the way people respond to electricity data in Nigeria starting with selected communities. This solution is called Upnepa.ng, an ecosystem of IoT device, mobile app, and web analytics that gives real-time information and historical data of electricity supply in selected communities and homes across Nigeria. With our solution, we equipped users with tools that detect the current state of power supply (On/Off), records the last time power was restored or disrupted and predicts when next it might be restored or disrupted
