# Connecting Smart things to the Internet

Over the past few months, I'm privileged to be working with a talented and dedicated team, together we've built a cloud-based device and technologies that is revolutionizing the way people respond to electricity data in Nigeria starting with selected communities. This solution is called Upnepa.ng, an ecosystem of IoT device, mobile app, and web analytics that gives real-time information and historical data of electricity supply in selected communities and homes across Nigeria. With our solution, we equipped users with tools that detect the current state of power supply (On/Off), records the last time power was restored or disrupted and predicts when next it might be restored or disrupted.

While building our sensory network for the device, one of the biggest challenges we faced was connectivity. This problem forms the basis of why I wrote this article. Building hardware devices especially internet connected ones takes a whole lot of work and expertise. To make the journey of others who might be planning on embarking on such projects easier, I will list and explain various methods available for connecting smart devices to the internet and also their advantages and drawbacks.

One thing we must take into consideration is that according to the laws of physics, we can never have a perfect method of communication as there will surely be a trade-off between bandwidth, power consumption, and range. Below are some of the connectivity options;

1. High Bandwidth, Low Range and Low Power Consumption Connectivity option: This method allows for the transmission of a large amount of data using a little amount of power but with little range. Example of such are Bluetooth, Ethernet,Wifi , etc. Bluetooth and Wifi are both wireless forms of this connectivity option while ethernet is the wired form of it. The drawback of this particular option is a range as they usually do not cover more than a few meters.
1. High Bandwidth, High Range, High Power Consumption Connectivity option: This method also allows for a large amount of data across long distance but with high power consumption. Example of such is GSM. Our mobile phones can send a large amount of data across a long distance but with high power consumption. This is evident in how fast batteries of these phones drain.
1. Low Bandwidth, High Range, Low Power Consumption Connectivity option: Here, a little amount of data is sent over long distances with little power consumption. This option is generally referred to as Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN). It is especially useful in IoT applications since IoT usually requires sensors to collect data such as temperature and send them across long distances.

Having considered the various options available, it is now left to each person to decide which option of connectivity is best suited to his/her intending application. Area of application, where the sensor will be planted and country of residence also plays a huge role in deciding the best connectivity option to be used. What is your view?
