In a couple of days, the year 2020 will come to a climax. It has been a rollercoaster of a year. During the course of the past few months, I got a lot of questions regarding how to start out in the field of Embedded systems especially in a place like Africa where opportunities to learn are scarce. That made me see a need to put up this article. Asides from this article, I will be dishing out content relating to Embedded Systems and the Internet of things has I have made getting more people into the embedded domain one of my goals for the new year. So join me on this journey!

For context, what is Embedded Systems? It can be defined as a combination of hardware and software which resides on the hardware, brought together to perform a specific function or specific user requirement. As opposed to a computer that can perform several operations, embedded systems are meant to perform specific tasks. Examples of such systems include Microwaves, Washing Machines, Digital thermometers, e.t.c

In order to provide a clear path to learn this interesting and ever dynamic field, I will like to segment the learning path into two:

1. Embedded Software
1. Embedded Hardware

## Embedded Software

* Learn C: About 95% of embedded systems applications are written in C. Understanding it will help you a lot in your Embedded systems journey. There are other programming languages (such as C++, Assembly, and Rust) that you must add to your arsenal as you progress. But for starters, C should come first. I recommend the book[Learn C the hard way by Zed Shaw](https://https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Hard-Way-Practical-Computational/dp/0321884922).
