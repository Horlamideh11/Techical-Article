# Building a Daily Standup Application in 30 Minutes

![Cover](https://i.imgur.com/cIavCTt.jpg)

The daily standup has become a norm in the schedule of most developers around the world. A standup is a daily team meeting, at a specific time for a specific duration, that asks team members to answer three major questions:

1. What did I work on yesterday?
1. What am I working on today?
1. What issues are blocking me?

The daily standup answers these questions but does not resolve them. When put to good use, daily standups increase team productivity and also enhance cohesion between all the parties involved.

## Tutorial Overview with Appsmith

In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to build a daily standup application using [Appsmith](https://www.appsmith.com/), an open-source framework for building internal tools, admin panels, dashboards, and workflows. You’ll be using Appsmith to forward a summary of daily standups to [Slack](https://slack.com/). Using a web framework like Appsmith is a much quicker way to add this feature to your workspace than building a completely new internal tool.
